This information alone does not explain why photosynthesis is considered a foundation of most food webs.\n\nOption C refers to carbon dioxide being more available than other gases because oceans have much more carbon dioxide than the atmosphere.

Germ cells are the primary cells that develop into male and female reproductive organs. They contain only 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 instead of 48).\n2.

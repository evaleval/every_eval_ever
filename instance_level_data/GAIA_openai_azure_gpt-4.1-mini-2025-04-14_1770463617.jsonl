Motivated by this chasm, we study the following natural question: Which instances of Set Cover can we solve faster than the simple dynamic programming algorithm? Specifically, we give a Monte Carlo algorithm that determines the existence of a set cover of size $\\sigma n$ in $O^*(2^{(1-\\Omega(\\sigma^4))n})$ time. Our approach is also applicable to Set Cover instances with exponentially many sets: By reducing the task of finding the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ of a given $n$-vertex graph $G$ to Set Cover in the natural way, we show there is an $O^*(2^{(1-\\Omega(\\sigma^4))n})$-time randomized algorithm that given integer $s=\\sigma n$, outputs NO if $\\chi(G) > s$ and YES with constant probability if

The problem of interpreting or aggregating multiple rankings is common to many\n                                         real-world applications. Perhaps the simplest and most common approach is a weighted rank aggre-\n                                         gation, wherein a (convex) weight is applied to each input ranking and then ordered. This paper\narXiv:2206.00001v1 [cs.IR] 31 May 2022\n\n\n\n\n                                         describes a new tool for visualizing and displaying ranking information for the weighted rank aggre-\n                                         gation method. Traditionally, the aim of rank aggregation is to summarize the information from the\n                                         input rankings and provide one final ranking that hopefully represents a more accurate or truthful\n                                         result than any one input ranking. While such an aggregated ranking is, and clearly has been, useful\n                                         to many applications, it also obscures information. In this paper, we show the wealth of information\n                                         that is available for the weighted rank aggregation problem due to its structure. We apply weight\n                                         set decomposition to the set of convex multipliers, study the properties useful for understanding this\n                                         decomposition, and visualize the indifference regions. This methodology reveals information–that\n                                         is otherwise collapsed by the aggregated ranking–into a useful, interpretable, and intuitive decision\n                                         support tool.

Introduction. Ranking is a common task in many applied fields includ-\n                                         ing machine learning, search, sports analytics/scheduling, economic forecasting, and\n                                         health care. Ranking is foundational to hundreds of algorithms designed by companies\n                                         such as Netflix, Amazon, and Google. Google’s algorithm for ranking the webpages\n                                         relevant to a user’s search query combines hundreds of ranking measures. The com-\n                                         bination of such measures is typically done with an aggregation method. One of the\n                                         simplest, and, therefore, perhaps most common, aggregation methods is some ver-\n                                         sion of a weighted average, weighted sum, linear combination, or convex combination.\n                                         Consider the following real-world applications.\n                                                • Prior to the Bowl Championship Series, U.S. college football teams were\n                                                  selected for post-season bowl games from a ranking that aggregated several\n                                                  rankings from coaches polls of rankings created by human experts as well as\n                                                  the rankings created by computer models, including the Massey and Colley\n                                                  models. The aggregated ranking ra = λ1 r1 +λ2 r2 +λ3 r3 +λ4 r4 +λ5 r5 +λ6 r6 ,\n                                                  where λi are the respective weights of the six rankings. Ratings can also be\n                                                  aggregated as discussed in Section 4.\n\n                                            ∗ Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Rice University, Houston, TX\n\n                                         (tyler.perini@rice.edu, http://www.tylerperini.com).\n                                            † Department of Mathematics, College of Charleston, Charleston, SC (langvillea@cofc.edu).\n                                            ‡ Chief Technology Officer, xCures, Inc.

For\n         example, the graduation rate contributes 8% while the faculty-to-student ra-\n         tio contributes 1%.\n       • A cancer research company creates a ranking of treatments tailored to in-\n         dividual patients by aggregating rankings from several sources of data. For\n         exposition, we describe three sources of data: biomarker data, data from ex-\n         pert oncologists, and clinical trials data. Each type of data creates a ranking\n         of treatments for the particular patient. A weighted combination aggregates\n         these three rankings into one final aggregated ranking ra = λ1 r1 +λ2 r2 +λ3 r3 ,\n         where λi are the weights given to each of the three rankings.\n     The aim of rank aggregation is to summarize the information from the input\nrankings and provide one final ranking, which should somehow represent a more\naccurate or truthful result. While such an aggregated ranking is, and clearly has\nbeen, useful to many applications, it also obscures information. Furthermore, after\nthe aggregated rank is produced, the summarization of information is often under-\nutilized. In this paper, we show the wealth of information that is available for the\nweighted rank aggregation problem due to its structure. In other words, we expand\nthe information collapsed by the aggregated ranking with the proposed weight set\ndecomposition and a powerful visualization tool.\n\n     1.1. Related Work. This work builds on three related topics. First is a 2007\npatent issued to Kramer [10] that describes a method for re-ranking search results\nbased on weights of three factors. The idea and tool described in the patent can be\napplied to diverse applications such as web search, product search, database search,\nfinancial planning, and survey results. The patent also describes the graphical user\ninterface for an interactive tool that allows users to move sliders to set the weights\nof the factors.

H divides Λ into two regions,\nand because H is linear, these two regions must also be convex. Case n: Assume\nthis is true for n, i.e., n separating hyperplanes divide Λ into smaller regions that are\nconvex. Case n + 1: Add one more separating hyperplane H. Each of the smaller\nregions in Λ is either intersected by H or not. Each intersected region is then divided\ninto two smaller regions, each of which must also be convex by the argument from\nthe base case (i.e., because H is linear).\n\n     Theorem 3.3 (Bound on cuts).

A heuristic algorithm approximates the\nrank colormap by grid search over weight set Λ by generating a finite number of\nequally spaced points in Λ, which are directly used to determine the weighted rank.\nA tighter grid leads to a more accurate colormap at the cost of more computations.\n     The exact algorithm proceeds according to the following steps.

The problem of interpreting or aggregating multiple rankings is common to many\n                                         real-world applications. Perhaps the simplest and most common approach is a weighted rank aggre-\n                                         gation, wherein a (convex) weight is applied to each input ranking and then ordered. This paper\narXiv:2206.00001v1 [cs.IR] 31 May 2022\n\n\n\n\n                                         describes a new tool for visualizing and displaying ranking information for the weighted rank aggre-\n                                         gation method. Traditionally, the aim of rank aggregation is to summarize the information from the\n                                         input rankings and provide one final ranking that hopefully represents a more accurate or truthful\n                                         result than any one input ranking. While such an aggregated ranking is, and clearly has been, useful\n                                         to many applications, it also obscures information. In this paper, we show the wealth of information\n                                         that is available for the weighted rank aggregation problem due to its structure. We apply weight\n                                         set decomposition to the set of convex multipliers, study the properties useful for understanding this\n                                         decomposition, and visualize the indifference regions. This methodology reveals information–that\n                                         is otherwise collapsed by the aggregated ranking–into a useful, interpretable, and intuitive decision\n                                         support tool.

Introduction. Ranking is a common task in many applied fields includ-\n                                         ing machine learning, search, sports analytics/scheduling, economic forecasting, and\n                                         health care. Ranking is foundational to hundreds of algorithms designed by companies\n                                         such as Netflix, Amazon, and Google. Google’s algorithm for ranking the webpages\n                                         relevant to a user’s search query combines hundreds of ranking measures. The com-\n                                         bination of such measures is typically done with an aggregation method. One of the\n                                         simplest, and, therefore, perhaps most common, aggregation methods is some ver-\n                                         sion of a weighted average, weighted sum, linear combination, or convex combination.\n                                         Consider the following real-world applications.\n                                                • Prior to the Bowl Championship Series, U.S. college football teams were\n                                                  selected for post-season bowl games from a ranking that aggregated several\n                                                  rankings from coaches polls of rankings created by human experts as well as\n                                                  the rankings created by computer models, including the Massey and Colley\n                                                  models.

(Left) Rank colormap for Patient A, Anne. (Right) Barchart displaying the percentage\nof Λ on the y-axis per region with the corresponding ranking labeled on the x-axis. A quick scan of\nthis barchart shows the relative area associated with each ranking.\n\n\n\n\n    The rank colormap summarizes a great deal of ranking information:\n     1. For Anne, there are 7 distinct indifference regions, one for each of the possible\n        aggregated rankings. Let A be the set of possible aggregated rankings. The\n        labels below each bar of the barchart of Fig. 3 (right) show that, for Anne’s\n        data, A = {[1 2 3 5 4], [1 2 3 4 5], [1 3 2 4 5], [1 3 4 5 2], [1 2 4 5 3], [1 3 2 5 4], [2 3 4 5 1]}.\n        The cardinality of this set, |A| =7, is an indication of the rankability of the\n        data [2, 3, 6, 11], a topic we will discussed earlier in Section 1.1.\n     2. The area of an indifference region in the colormap indicates the aggregated\n        ranking’s sensitivity to small changes in the weights. The bar chart on the\n        right of Figure 3 shows both the number of aggregated rankings as well as\n        the area associated with each aggregated ranking. An indifference region with\n        small area (e.g., ranking [2 3 4 5 1] at 4.3%) that is sensitive to these changes\n        is generally less preferred than an indifference region with a large area (e.g.,\n        ranking [1 2 3 5 4] at 24.4%), which is insensitive or robust. For Anne, quality\n        of life ranking r3 is the most sensitive ranking, since the pink region at the\n        top of the colormap has the smallest area. The longevity ranking r2 is slightly\n        more sensitive than the simplicity ranking r1 .\n     3. Indifference regions in the colormap clearly indicate adjacency between ag-\n        gregated rankings. Each neighboring region in the colormap is just one swap\n        away from one another. These adjacencies may be useful in designing paths\n        of sequential solutions, e.g., for adjusting a patient’s treatment in response to\n        outcomes.\n     4. Two n × n matrices X∗ and A∗ are created from the set A of aggregated\n        rankings. The (i, j) element of X∗ is the number of rankings in A ranking\n", "reasoning_trace": null, "tool_calls": [], "tool_call_id": "call_eLjnndVqrvXaX1UeoP6toV8d"}, {"turn_idx": 50, "role": "assistant", "content": "", "reasoning_trace": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_SB9UDHqPGtK9GMWJ2WG12WoB", "name": "web_browser_go", "arguments": {"url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03439"}}], "tool_call_id": null}, {"turn_idx": 51, "role": "tool", "content": "accessibility tree:\n[16662] banner \n  [16666] link \"Cornell University\"  [url: https://www.cornell.edu/]\n  [16472] StaticText \"We gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, \" \n  [16669] link \"member institutions\"  [url: https://info.arxiv.org/about/ourmembers.html]\n  [16474] StaticText \", and all contributors.\" \n  [16670] link \"Donate\"  [url: https://info.arxiv.org/about/donate.html]\n  [16674] link \"arxiv logo\"  [url: https://arxiv.org/]\n  [16476] StaticText \">\" \n  [16676] link \"cs\"  [url: https://arxiv.org/list/cs/recent]\n  [16478] StaticText \">\" \n  [16479] StaticText \"arXiv:1608.03439\" \n  [16683] textbox \"Search term or terms\"  [editable: plaintext, required]\n  [16687] link \"Help\"  [url: https://info.arxiv.org/help]\n  [16482] StaticText \" | \" \n  [16688] link \"Advanced Search\"  [url: https://arxiv.org/search/advanced]\n  [16691] combobox \"Field to search\" Current input: \"All fields\"  [hasPopup: menu, expanded]\n  [16744] button \"Search\" \n[16784] main \n  [16789] heading \"Computer Science > Data Structures and Algorithms\" \n  [16487] StaticText \"[Submitted on 11 Aug 2016]\" \n  [16796] heading \"Finding Large Set Covers Faster via the Representation Method\" \n  [16800] link \"Jesper Nederlof\"  [url: https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Nederlof,+J]\n  [16803] blockquote \n    [16490] StaticText \"The worst-case fastest known algorithm for the Set Cover problem on universes with $n$ elements still essentially is the simple $O^*(2^n)$-time dynamic programming algorithm, and no non-trivial consequences of an $O^*(1.01^n)$-time algorithm are known. Motivated by this chasm, we study the following natural question: Which instances of Set Cover can we solve faster than the simple dynamic programming algorithm? Specifically, we give a Monte Carlo algorithm that determines the existence of a set cover of size $\\sigma n$ in $O^*(2^{(1-\\Omega(\\sigma^4))n})$ time. Our approach is also applicable to Set Cover instances with exponentially many sets: By reducing the task of finding the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ of a given $n$-vertex graph $G$ to Set Cover in the natural way, we show there is an $O^*(2^{(1-\\Omega(\\sigma^4))n})$-time randomized algorithm that given integer $s=\\sigma n$, outputs NO if $\\chi(G) > s$ and YES with constant probability if

Motivated by this chasm, we study the\n                                         following natural question: Which instances of Set Cover can we solve faster than the simple\n                                         dynamic programming algorithm? Specifically, we give a Monte Carlo algorithm that determines\n                                         the existence of a set cover of size σn in O∗ (2(1−Ω(σ ))n ) time. Our approach is also applicable to\n                                                                                                4\n\n\n                                         Set Cover instances with exponentially many sets: By reducing the task of finding the chromatic\n                                         number χ(G) of a given n-vertex graph G to Set Cover in the natural way, we show there is an\n                                         O∗ (2(1−Ω(σ ))n )-time randomized algorithm that given integer s = σn, outputs NO if χ(G) > s\n                                                      4\n\n\n                                         and YES with constant probability if χ(G) ≤ s − 1.\n                                              On a high level, our results are inspired by the ‘representation method’ of Howgrave-Graham\n                                         and Joux [EUROCRYPT’10] and obtained by only evaluating a randomly sampled subset of the\n                                         table entries of a dynamic programming algorithm.\n\n                                         1998 ACM Subject Classification G.2.2 Graph Algorithms, Hypergraphs\n\n                                         Keywords and phrases Set Cover, Exact Exponential Algorithms, Fine-Grained Complexity\n\n                                         Digital Object Identifier 10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2016.[79]\n\n", "reasoning_trace": null, "tool_calls": [], "tool_call_id": "call_zGQoFoHJAU0bLZrZK1N9fBzx"}, {"turn_idx": 62, "role": "assistant", "content": "", "reasoning_trace": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_GOyYZ7GAhnoboo7A1WyyctL6", "name": "bash", "arguments": {"cmd": "grep -i \"figure\" paper2016.txt | head -30"}}], "tool_call_id": null}, {"turn_idx": 63, "role": "tool", "content": "description of the Algorithm A1 is given in Figure 1:\n   Figure 1 High level description of the Algorithm implementing Theorem 4.2.\nimum size of the (down/up)-closure of W in Algorithm A1 in Figure 1.\n          Proof.
